# BDSP-PokemonCloning
An automation program based on "Pokémon Automation - Microcontroller Programs" that clones Pokemon in BDSP.


This is a custom program that utilizes Pokémon Automation's Microcontroller Programs, found here: https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller
Thanks to all the work that team has put into making such a great utility. Just like their repo, this repo is under the MIT License.

This native microcontroller program is based on the cloning glitch in Pokemon BDSP. A video run-down of how it works can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPXI3knuhkg

# Installation
To use this program you must have Pokémon Automation's Microcontroller Programs downloaded, found here: https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/releases.
Download the BDSP-PokemonCloning files, found here: https://github.com/HetchBug/BDSP-PokemonCloning/releases

Then copy the two folders from this repo into your PA-NativePrograms-X.Y.Z folder and allow it to overwrite the ProgramList.txt file. If you don't do this, then this program will not show up when you try to open the hex generator.
